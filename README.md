## Theoretical description and explanation

Our group decided to make a PWM-Based Servo Motor Controller code. We want to create a controller that will turn the servo motor in the range of 100 degrees. There will be two independent servos connected to the Nexys board, where the function of controlling only one servo will be shown. With turning on or off the switch on the left, it will determine wheter the servo motors will be turning fast or slow (or differently said - rough or fine movement). with turning the right switches on or off will determine which of the connected servos will be operated and which will stay in their position.
